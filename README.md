# Modified-RapSquare
The aim was to give the already existing webpage a revamp using bootstrap.I incoprated things such as jumbotrons, cards, a registration form and a footer. Of course these are just but a few examples of all the bootstrap elements i was able to interact with. I was able to include some custom CSS as well.
